###### Previous Experience
1. **ML Intern @ Raytheon Technology**: Worked on improving interpretability of SAR data and fusing them with multispectral and optical images.
2. **Project Intern @ ISRO (URSC)**: Worked on developing LSTM & GNN-based Inter-Satellite Link (ISL) algorithms for satellite communication. Also, prototyped a novel satellite constellation for Lunar-Earth Communication. Mission Support for the Aditya-L1 mission.
3. **ML Intern @ LIGO India (IUCAA Pune)**: Worked on identification of gravitational waves from Binary Black Hole Merger using signal processing and deep learning

###### Other Achievements
1. Hold 2 trade secrets for my work at ISRO.
2. Co-founded Space Research Group [STeRG](https://www.instagram.com/sterg_official/) at university (MIT Pune).

##### Why this website?
I created to website to document my research and learning; or anything I found interesting. Hence, I'm still putting things in place but here are a few of my blog posts:

* [[BackPropogation: Math & Intution]]()
* [Neural Collapse & Long-Tail in NN]()
* [[Agents: Architecture and Imlementation (from scratch)]]()
* [Do DL models overfit?]()
* [[Controls: AODS & Thrust Vectoring for sounding rockets]]()
* [[SAR: Interpretability & Fusion]]()

Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gaurang, I work on Agents and Language Models (RAG, Knowledge Graphs) in Applied Research at Raytheon Technologies. My board research interests include: Agentic AI, Mechanistic Interpretability, and fundamental deep learning. 

Previous Experience:
1. ML Intern @ Raytheon Technology: Worked on improving interpretability of SAR data and fusing them with multispectral and optical images
2. Project Intern @ ISRO (URSC): Worked on developing LSTM & GNN based Inter-Satellite Link (ISL) algorithms for satellite communication. Also, prototyped a novel satellite constellation for Lunar - Earth Communication. Mission Support for Aditya-L1 mission.
3. ML Intern @ LIGO India (IUCAA Pune): Worked on identification of Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Hole Merger

Other Achinevements:
1. Hold 2 trade secrets for my work at ISRO
2. Co-founded Space Research Group at university (MIT Pune)


##### Research Interest
TLDR: still exploring
